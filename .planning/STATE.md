# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** Developers can build Textual-quality TUI applications in Rust — declare widgets, style with CSS, react to events, get a polished result on any terminal.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P01 | 2 | 2 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 01-foundation P02 | 4 | 3 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Build on ratatui + crossterm rather than raw terminal — eliminates buffer diffing, Unicode, and constraint layout reimplementation
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Tokio LocalSet for widget tree thread — avoids Send + 'static pressure on widget state; flume bridges keyboard thread to async loop
- [Pre-Phase 1]: slotmap arena for widget tree — generational indices prevent use-after-free; no unsafe parent pointers
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Taffy layout engine chosen over ratatui Cassowary — required for CSS Grid, absolute positioning, align-items, gap
- [Pre-Phase 1]: reactive_graph for signals — MEDIUM confidence; needs Executor::init_tokio + LocalSet spike before Phase 3 planning
- [Phase 01-foundation]: futures 0.3 added as full dependency (not dev-only) — StreamExt used in library code app.rs, not test code only
- [Phase 01-foundation]: App::run() renders initial frame before event loop — box visible immediately without waiting for first event
- [Phase 01-foundation]: render_frame requires B::Error: Send + Sync + 'static to satisfy anyhow::Error From conversion
- [Phase 01-foundation]: run_async refactored to use render_frame for both initial render and resize redraw keeping render path DRY

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: SlotMap borrow ergonomics spike required before planning — HopSlotMap vs AppContext pattern must be verified (cannot hold &mut Widget and &mut Arena simultaneously)
- [Phase 3]: reactive_graph + Tokio LocalSet spike required before planning — Executor::init_tokio() + any_spawner API must be verified against current published version; effect batching for render debounce needs POC
