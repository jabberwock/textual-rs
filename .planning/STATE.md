# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Developers can build Textual-quality TUI applications in Rust -- declare widgets, style with CSS, react to events, get a polished result on any terminal.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — platform-verification-and-publish

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (platform-verification-and-publish) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-28

### Progress

```
v1.3: [          ] 0% (0/6 phases)
```

Phase 5  [ ] Screen Stack
Phase 6  [ ] Render-Only Foundation Widgets
Phase 7  [ ] List and Selection Widgets
Phase 8  [ ] Enhanced Display Widgets
Phase 9  [ ] Complex Widgets
Phase 10 [ ] Platform Verification and Publish

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (v1.3)

- CI uses dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable (not dtolnay/rust-action/setup@v1 which returns 404) (10-01)
- Docs CI job added with RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings; will fail until Plan 02 adds rustdoc — expected (10-01)
- #![deny(missing_docs)] belongs in Plan 02 alongside the full doc pass, not Plan 01 (10-01)
- #![allow(missing_docs)] added to widget/mod.rs suppresses all widget subtree lint — allows deny at crate level while deferring widget docs to 10-04 (10-02)
- All core infrastructure (31 files) fully documented; widget docs deferred to plan 10-04 (10-02)
- LoadingIndicator uses ctx.spinner_tick (not own tick) for synchronized overlay animation across all instances (08-02)
- set_loading() uses SecondaryMap<WidgetId,bool> — supports multiple simultaneous loading widgets (08-02)
- Loading overlay drawn over full rect (including borders) for visual continuity (08-02)
- RichLog uses imported `Line` type alias — `Reactive<Vec<Line<'static>>>` is `Reactive<Vec<ratatui::text::Line<'static>>>` (08-01)
- RichLog PageUp/PageDown added beyond minimum 4 bindings for usability (08-01)
- `focus_history: Vec<Option<WidgetId>>` must be added to AppContext before any screen stack consumer code is written
- Toast uses `Vec<ToastEntry>` on AppContext — NOT `active_overlay` (that slot is single-instance only)
- MaskedInput cursor tracked in raw-value space only; display cursor derived per render
- ContentSwitcher uses `recompose_widget` pattern, not CSS display toggling (Taffy has no display:none)
- DirectoryTree filesystem I/O always via `ctx.run_worker`, never in `on_event` or `compose`
- cargo publish --dry-run for textual-rs errors (not warns) when macros not on crates.io yet — expected, resolves after publishing macros first (10-03)
- Publish order mandatory: textual-rs-macros first, ~60s propagation, then textual-rs (10-03)

### Research Flags (resolve during phase planning)

- Phase 5: `push_screen_wait` async variant scope decision; screen suspend/resume lifecycle events scope
- Phase 8: `widget.loading = true` base-class overlay integration scope vs. standalone widget only
- Phase 9: DirectoryTree symlink detection on Windows NTFS; Toast z-order vs. active_overlay

### Dependencies

- walkdir 2 (new dep) — DirectoryTree filesystem traversal
- serde_json 1 with preserve_order feature (new dep) — Pretty widget
