# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** Developers can build Textual-quality TUI applications in Rust — declare widgets, style with CSS, react to events, get a polished result on any terminal.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — built-in-widget-library

## Current Position

Phase: 5
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Build on ratatui + crossterm rather than raw terminal — eliminates buffer diffing, Unicode, and constraint layout reimplementation
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Tokio LocalSet for widget tree thread — avoids Send + 'static pressure on widget state; flume bridges keyboard thread to async loop
- [Pre-Phase 1]: slotmap arena for widget tree — generational indices prevent use-after-free; no unsafe parent pointers
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Taffy layout engine chosen over ratatui Cassowary — required for CSS Grid, absolute positioning, align-items, gap
- [Pre-Phase 1]: reactive_graph for signals — MEDIUM confidence; needs Executor::init_tokio + LocalSet spike before Phase 3 planning
- [Phase 01-foundation]: futures 0.3 added as full dependency (not dev-only) — StreamExt used in library code app.rs, not test code only
- [Phase 01-foundation]: App::run() renders initial frame before event loop — box visible immediately without waiting for first event
- [Phase 01-foundation]: render_frame requires B::Error: Send + Sync + 'static to satisfy anyhow::Error From conversion
- [Phase 01-foundation]: run_async refactored to use render_frame for both initial render and resize redraw keeping render path DRY
- [Phase 02-widget-tree-layout-and-styling]: on_mount/on_unmount take &self only — avoids borrow conflict; ctx-mutating lifecycle deferred to Phase 3
- [Phase 02-widget-tree-layout-and-styling]: ctx-passing pattern confirmed: AppContext owns all widget state, Widget trait takes &AppContext for reads — resolves SlotMap borrow ergonomics blocker
- [Phase 02-widget-tree-layout-and-styling]: App owns AppContext + TaffyBridge + Stylesheet vec as integration layer; full_render_pass implements cascade→layout→render sequence
- [Phase 02-widget-tree-layout-and-styling]: TaffyBridge forces root screen node to Dimension::length(cols/rows) — prevents Auto-sized root from shrinking to content
- [Phase 02-widget-tree-layout-and-styling]: compose_subtree (recursive) replaces single-level compose_children in push_screen — required for multi-level widget hierarchies
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: MSRV bumped to 1.88 — required by reactive_graph 0.2.13
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: Owner stored as Option<Owner> on App — initialized in run_async not new() since tokio runtime not yet live at construction
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: event_tx stored on AppContext (not App) — widgets receive AppContext in handlers making it the natural reactive injection point
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: RenderRequest coalescing uses try_recv drain loop — cheapest single-tick batching with zero overhead
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: message_queue uses RefCell<Vec<...>> on AppContext — allows post_message(&self) from on_event/on_action without borrow conflict
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: AppEvent::Message variant rejected — Box<dyn Any> breaks Clone/Debug on AppEvent; message_queue field is cleaner
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: drain_message_queue bounded at 100 iterations to prevent infinite message loops while supporting recursive dispatch
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: TestApp processes events synchronously via process_event — no async event loop in tests, precise timing control
- [Phase 03-reactive-system-events-and-testing]: settle() uses yield_now loop (max 100 iterations) to drain reactive effects, checks empty rx+message_queue for quiescence
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: Use get_untracked() in all widget render() methods — avoids reactive tracking loops outside reactive owner context
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: Cell<Option<WidgetId>> set in on_mount enables post_message from on_action(&self) without &mut; static &[KeyBinding] slices for zero-allocation key bindings
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: pending_screen_pushes RefCell on AppContext with push_screen_deferred() — deferred screen push from on_action(&self) for Select widget overlay pattern
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: TextArea tests verify state via rendered buffer rows — message queue is drained by process_event before assertions
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: pending_screen_pops: Cell<usize> and pop_screen_deferred() added to AppContext for Select overlay dismissal
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: Cell<bool> for valid state in Input — consistent with Cell<usize> cursor pattern, avoids &mut in event handlers
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: run_validation() called inside emit_changed() — single call site keeps validity fresh before message emission
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: Input validation tests use inject_key_event() not pilot.type_text() — type_text drains queue via settle(), leaving nothing to inspect
- [Phase 04-built-in-widget-library]: All 22 WIDGET-* requirements marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md after gap closure
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: Worker results use dedicated flume channel (worker_tx/worker_rx) not AppEvent variant — avoids Clone/Debug requirement on Box<dyn Any + Send>
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: process_deferred_screens() extracted as App helper — called consistently after key events, mouse events, and worker results
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: WorkerResult<T> includes source_id field for multi-worker disambiguation in on_event handlers
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: advance_focus() called after palette push so Esc/Enter keys reach CommandPalette (focused_widget must point to overlay)
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: fuzzy_score returns 1.0 for exact substring matches, Jaro-Winkler for approximate matches, threshold 0.3 for palette filtering
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: Tutorial examples registered in [[example]] sections of Cargo.toml (not auto-discovered)
- [Phase 05-developer-experience-and-polish]: External .tcss files via include_str!() preferred over inline const CSS in demo examples

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED Phase 2]: SlotMap borrow ergonomics spike required before planning — RESOLVED: ctx-passing pattern (AppContext) confirmed working. HopSlotMap not needed.
- [Phase 3]: reactive_graph + Tokio LocalSet spike required before planning — Executor::init_tokio() + any_spawner API must be verified against current published version; effect batching for render debounce needs POC
