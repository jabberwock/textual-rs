# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Developers can build Textual-quality TUI applications in Rust -- declare widgets, style with CSS, react to events, get a polished result on any terminal.
**Current focus:** v1.3 Widget Parity & Ship — Phase 5: Screen Stack

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 5 — Screen Stack (not started)
Plan: —
Status: Ready for phase planning
Last activity: 2026-03-26 — Roadmap created for v1.3

### Progress

```
v1.3: [          ] 0% (0/6 phases)

Phase 5  [ ] Screen Stack
Phase 6  [ ] Render-Only Foundation Widgets
Phase 7  [ ] List and Selection Widgets
Phase 8  [ ] Enhanced Display Widgets
Phase 9  [ ] Complex Widgets
Phase 10 [ ] Platform Verification and Publish

### History
- v1.0 MVP: 5 phases, 22 plans — shipped 2026-03-26
- v1.1 Visual Parity: 3 phases, 6 plans — shipped 2026-03-27
- v1.2 Production Readiness: 1 phase, 5 plans — shipped 2026-03-27

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 260326-uwc | Mouse capture push/pop stack and Shift modifier bypass | 2026-03-27 | 2674edb | [260326-uwc](./quick/260326-uwc-mouse-capture-push-pop-stack-and-shift-m/) |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (v1.3)
- `focus_history: Vec<Option<WidgetId>>` must be added to AppContext before any screen stack consumer code is written
- Toast uses `Vec<ToastEntry>` on AppContext — NOT `active_overlay` (that slot is single-instance only)
- MaskedInput cursor tracked in raw-value space only; display cursor derived per render
- ContentSwitcher uses `recompose_widget` pattern, not CSS display toggling (Taffy has no display:none)
- DirectoryTree filesystem I/O always via `ctx.run_worker`, never in `on_event` or `compose`

### Research Flags (resolve during phase planning)
- Phase 5: `push_screen_wait` async variant scope decision; screen suspend/resume lifecycle events scope
- Phase 8: `widget.loading = true` base-class overlay integration scope vs. standalone widget only
- Phase 9: DirectoryTree symlink detection on Windows NTFS; Toast z-order vs. active_overlay

### Dependencies
- walkdir 2 (new dep) — DirectoryTree filesystem traversal
- serde_json 1 with preserve_order feature (new dep) — Pretty widget
