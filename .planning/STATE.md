# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Developers can build Textual-quality TUI applications in Rust -- declare widgets, style with CSS, react to events, get a polished result on any terminal.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Phase 2 -- Interactive States & Rendering

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (Interactive States & Rendering)
Plan: 2 of 2 complete in phase 2 (phase complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-26 -- Completed 02-01 (Hover tracking, button pressed state, input invalid border)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (5/5 plans in phases 1-2)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:** Carried from v1.0

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01 | 01 | 188s | 1 | 2 |
| 01 | 02 | 204s | 1 | 4 |
| 02 | 02 | 240s | 2 | 6 |
| 02 | 01 | ~480s | 2 | 6 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v1.0]: All v1.0 decisions remain valid
- [v1.1-pre]: McGugan Box borders implemented using one-eighth/quarter block chars
- [v1.1-pre]: Canvas module has halfblock, eighth-block, quadrant, braille primitives
- [v1.1-pre]: border: inner CSS keyword maps to McguganBox style
- [v1.1-pre]: All widgets upgraded with color-differentiated states (green accent for active/selected, muted for inactive)
- [v1.1-pre]: Mouse click support added to all interactive widgets via click_action() and on_event()
- [v1.1-01-01]: Pure-math HSL conversion (no external crate) for shade generation
- [v1.1-01-01]: Panel color = blend(surface, primary, 0.1) matching Python Textual
- [v1.1-01-02]: Two-phase variable resolution (parse as Variable, resolve at cascade time) -- keeps parse signature stable
- [v1.1-01-02]: Border color variables ($primary in border shorthand) deferred to future plan
- [v1.1-02-02]: Quadrant anti-diagonal/diagonal (0b1001/0b0110) pattern for Placeholder cross-hatch
- [v1.1-02-02]: Half-block gradient on empty track only, progress fill overlaid on top
- [v1.1-02-02]: Header single-row uses blended bg (not half-block) to preserve text
- [v1.1-02-01]: border_color_override() trait method for widget-driven border color (Input invalid -> red)
- [v1.1-02-01]: Render priority: widget override > focus > hover > default CSS
- [v1.1-02-01]: Button pressed is single-frame REVERSED flash, reset in render()

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- U+1FB87 (Right One Quarter Block) requires Unicode 13 font support -- may not render on all terminals
- CSS variables ($primary, $surface, etc.) now resolve during cascade -- border shorthand variables not yet supported
- Sparkline braille rendering not visually verified on real terminal
