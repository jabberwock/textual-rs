# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Developers can build Textual-quality TUI applications in Rust -- declare widgets, style with CSS, react to events, get a polished result on any terminal.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Phase 1 -- Semantic Theme Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Semantic Theme Engine)
Plan: 1 of 2 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-26 -- Completed 01-01 (Theme struct, shade generation, default dark theme)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50% (1/2 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:** Carried from v1.0

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01 | 01 | 188s | 1 | 2 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v1.0]: All v1.0 decisions remain valid
- [v1.1-pre]: McGugan Box borders implemented using one-eighth/quarter block chars
- [v1.1-pre]: Canvas module has halfblock, eighth-block, quadrant, braille primitives
- [v1.1-pre]: border: inner CSS keyword maps to McguganBox style
- [v1.1-pre]: All widgets upgraded with color-differentiated states (green accent for active/selected, muted for inactive)
- [v1.1-pre]: Mouse click support added to all interactive widgets via click_action() and on_event()
- [v1.1-01-01]: Pure-math HSL conversion (no external crate) for shade generation
- [v1.1-01-01]: Panel color = blend(surface, primary, 0.1) matching Python Textual

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- U+1FB87 (Right One Quarter Block) requires Unicode 13 font support -- may not render on all terminals
- CSS variables ($primary, $surface, etc.) not implemented -- widget defaults using them are silently ignored
- Sparkline braille rendering not visually verified on real terminal
